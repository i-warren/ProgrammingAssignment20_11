*20.11 (MATCH GROUPING SYMBOLS) A Java program contains various pairs of grouping symbols, such as:

Parentheses: ( and )

Braces: { and }

Brackets: [ and ]

Note the grouping symbols cannot overlap. For example, (a{b)} is illegal. Write a program to check whether a Java 
source-code file has correct pairs of grouping symbols. Pass the source-code file name as a command-line argument.
